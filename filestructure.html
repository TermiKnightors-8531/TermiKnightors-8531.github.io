            <h3 class="sectHead">Basic File Structure</h3>
            <h3 class="nestHead">When in doubt, write your code in Robot.java</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                For beginning purposes, code should be written in the /src/.../ Robot.java file in the appropriate method.
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">{Write in the Curly Brackets}</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                Code is (almost) always written within the curly brackets of a method. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="nestHead">Import Space</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                The section highligted in pink is where you can import all of the necesarry libraries. For example, the line 
                <span class="code">import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.TimedRobot;</span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead" style="font-style:italic">The Shelf</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                Although not an official term, the shelf is the space within the curly brackets of a class, but outside
                of a method. The shelf is used for defining objects that must be accessed in multiple methods. This allows 
                them to be visible everywhere in the code (effectively). <strong>You cannot call methods from the shelf.</strong>
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">Init vs. Periodic</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                An init method is called at the beginning of a certain time period and only runs once. This is a good place to 
                initialize necesarry variables or reset entries that only need to happen once. At the beginning of the teleop periodic,
                the init method is only called once. The periodic methods are called over and over.
                For example, the teleop periodic runs repeatedly whenever the robot is in teleop mode. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">Robot Methods</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                These methods are called whenver the robot is enabled. This is a good time to service things such as pneumatics or read values
                that must be monitored always. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">Autonomous Methods</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                These methods only run for the autonomous period. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">Teleop Methods</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                These methods only run for the autonomous period. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">Disabled Methods</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                We don't often use these methods. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">Test Methods</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                This can be used to test certain functionality without it having to running during a match.
