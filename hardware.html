        <h3 class="nestHead">What is an ID</h3>
        <p class="nestInfo">
            All of the motor controllers are daisy chained together. Each one hears the same message, but only 
            responds to ones addressed to its ID. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="nestHead">How do I set an ID?</h3>
        <p class="nestInfo">
            First log in to the robotics computer and open the RevRobotics software. Ensure that the SparkMax is 
            connected to battery power and connect an orange USB cable between the SparkMax and the computer. You
            should see a screen similar to the one below. Click on the desired motor controller to select it.  
            <img src="/imgs/rev/revstart.png" style="width:90%" alt="">
            <br><br>
            Then another screen will pop up. To properly configure the motor controller, first determine what type of motor you want to control. 
            If you are working with a NEO motor, select the <strong>Motor Type</strong> as brushless. Otherwise, 
            select brushed! In the CAN ID field, enter your desired id. <br>
            <span class="important">
                To upload your information to the controller, scroll down and click <strong>Burn Flash</strong>
            </span><br>

            <img src="/imgs/rev/rev-specific.png" style="width:75%" alt="">
            <br>
        </p>
            
        <h3 class="nestHead">What if I get the message CAN Bus unavailable?</h3>
        <p class="nestInfo">
            First, ensure that the SparkMax is connected to battery power. Also, try flipping the USB connector
            orientation in the SparkMax. This shouldn't matter, but sometimes it does...
            <strong>Another good solution is to spam the Scan for Devices button while screaming internally.</strong>
