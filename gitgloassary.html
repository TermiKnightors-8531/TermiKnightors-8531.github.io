            a location for all of your code. The master branch is the default branch, however creating new branches is a good
            idea when testing out a drastic change. Branches are a safe way to share sketchy code without murdering our function master branch!

            <h3 class="nestHead">What is a commit?</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">When you commit to git, you are publishing your changes to everyone in the repository. Normally 
                you will commit at the end of a coding session or at a land mark. Try not to dump massive amounts of code in one commit. 
                Commits should really just nice chunks of what changes you made. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">What is a commit message</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                A commit message is a description of the changes that you made. It is a short two to six-ish word summary of what you did.
                Examples of good commit messages are: "added button mapping" , "fixed drive error", "added arm functions", etc. Don't be 
                like me two years ago. Some bad, but real commit messages are things like "dump", "dead computer", "aaaaaah", "idk man", etc. 
                <strong>PLEASE, don't be stupid like me...</strong>
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">When should I commit?</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                At the end of a meeting or after a major change, it's always good to commit. Whenever you log off your computer for the day after coding, 
                <strong>commit your changes</strong>.
