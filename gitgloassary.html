                To open the command pallete in VSCode, press the buttons <strong>CTL+SHIT+P</strong>. This should open
                something that looks similar to the image below. <br>

                <br>Here, we can access all of the commands necesarry to run git and also deploy our robot code when it becomes necesarry. 
                <strong>To access git commands, open the pallete and type in the git.</strong> This will open up many different suggestions. 
                We'll address what they all mean later.

            <h3 class="nestHead">What is a commit?</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">When you commit to git, you are publishing your changes to everyone in the repository. Normally 
                you will commit at the end of a coding session or at a land mark. Try not to dump massive amounts of code in one commit. 
                Commits should really just nice chunks of what changes you made. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">What is a commit message</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                A commit message is a description of the changes that you made. It is a short two to six-ish word summary of what you did.
                Examples of good commit messages are: "added button mapping" , "fixed drive error", "added arm functions", etc. Don't be 
                like me two years ago. Some bad, but real commit messages are things like "dump", "dead computer", "aaaaaah", "idk man", etc. 
                <strong>PLEASE, don't be stupid like me...</strong>
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">When should I commit?</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                At the end of a meeting or after a major change, it's always good to commit. Whenever you log off your computer for the day after coding, 
                <strong>commit your changes</strong>. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">How do I commit?</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                Although you can use the <a href="#cmd-pal">command pallete</a>, it's much easier to the use the spaghetti and
                meatball icon. <br> 
                <img src="/imgs/GitPage.png" alt="" style="height:30%; width:20%">
                <br> Once you've opened this icon, if you've modified files, you'll see them at the right. 
                To add a file to your next commit, click the plus arrow next to it. When you commit, try to group files based on 
                the changes that you have had. If you've changed code for the arm in two files, add those files to your commit. 
                Then, add a commit message to describe what you did. <br><br> You can hit the purple commit checkmark. Repeat this process 
                for all of the groups of files that you are going to commit. Then, a button will appear that allows you to sync changes. 
                Click this and then you've completed all of your commits!

            <h3 class="nestHead">What is a branch?</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                A branch is a place to store code within our repository. It is a way for us to work on code in parallel without 
                murdering our master branch. The master branch is a location where our main code lives. 
                For example of branches, if one of us is working on the arm code, and another is working on 
                button mapping, this is a great time to use branches. The development can happen independently without conflicts.
                When ready, we can merge these changes into our master branch. 
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="nestHead">How do I create a branch?</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                To navigate and move between branches, open the <a href="#cmd-pal">command pallete</a>. To create a new branch,
                type <strong>git: create branch from...</strong> into the command pallete. Enter a name for the new branch. Normally,
                this name should be a short and descriptive one. Things like "arm test" or "button mapping" are good options. After this, 
                you will most often create the branch from the main one.<br>
                <img src="/imgs/git-branch.png" alt="">
                <br> Once you have finished and are ready to commit, you must first publish the branch. There will be a button in the 
                spaghetti and meatball icon to do so!
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">How do I change branches?</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                Enter the <a href="#cmd-pal">command pallete</a> and type git: checkout to. From here, you can select the branch in which you
                want to make changes.
