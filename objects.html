                Add the following line in your import space:

            <h3 class="nestHead">How do I create a motor object?</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                The CANSparkMax object is found under the <span class="className">CANSparkMax</span>
                class. It takes two parameters: (canID, MotorType). The first parameter is the canID (an int), set within
                motor controller. The second parameter is an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_enums.asp" target="_blank">enum</a>
                . The two types, MotorType.kBrushed and MotorType.kBrushless, are used to select the motor type. If we're working with a NEO, 
                use the brushless type. Otherwise, use brushed! In full, the code looks like this: <br> <br> 
                
                <span class="code"> CANSparkMax m1 = CANSparkMax(1, MotorType.kBrushless);</span>

            <h3 class="nestHead">Moving the Motor</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                To bring the motor to a set point, you can utilize the method, .set(d), where d is a value from -1 to 1. For example, the code 
                <span class="code">m1.set(.3)</span> sets the m1 motor object to 30%.

            <p class="nestInfo">
                A drive train object is created through the following line. 
                <span class="code">DriveTrain dt = new DriveTrain(i1,i2,i3,i4);</span>
                It takes four parameters which are the ids of each drive motor. i1 and i2 are the ids of the front and rear left 
                drive motors and i3 and i4 are the ids front and rear right drive motors.

                First, place this statement into your imports: <span class="code">import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.XboxController;</span>
                The controller object takes one int as a parameter. This is the specific port on the driver station. To declare
                a controller at index 0, use the following code: <br><br>
                 <span class="code">XboxController xb = XboxController(0);</span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="nestHead">Methods for Getting Buttons</h3>
            <p class="nestInfo">
                A complete reference of all of the methods can be found 
                <a href="https://first.wpi.edu/wpilib/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/XboxController.html">here</a>. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>An important note: </strong> There are 3 different ways to read a button. The first, .get[ specific button], 
                reads the value of a button at the instant of reading. The other two go hand in hand, the get pressed and get released. This is helpful
                when trying to initiate a task or stop it. Rather than reading the value every time, the getPressed and getReleased methods 
                allow for safer starting and stopping of tasks that need to start and end in precise ways.

                The two methods that we will use most often are <span class="code">xboxObject.getLeftY();</span> and
                <span class="code">xboxObject.getRightY();</span> These methods return a double from -1 to 1 signifying the 
                position of the respective joystick on the XBoxController.
